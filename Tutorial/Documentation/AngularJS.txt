ANGULARJS

AngularJS is a MVW (Model-View-Whatever) JavaScript framework, that enhances HTML for web apps, by extending
standard HTML tags and properties with DIRECTIVES to binds events and data (DATA BINDING) into it using EXPRESSIONS.

DIRECTIVES are extensions of HTML markups (attributes, element names, CSS class or HTML comments).

DATA BINDING is an feature that syncronizes your model data with your HTML.
Whenever the HTML is changed, the modal gets updated.
Wherever the model gets updated it is reflected in HTML.

SCOPE ($scope) it is an object that contains all the data to which HTML is bound.
They are the link between your javascript code (controllers) and the view (HTML).
Also everything that is attached to the $scope, it is watched ($watch) by AngularJS and updated.

CONTROLLERS are javascript code that "controls" some sections containing DOM elements.
Encapsulate the behavior and callbacks. Also link $scope models with views.

MODULES are a way to encapsulate different parts of your application.
They allow reusing code in other places, just like dependencies.

TEMPLATES contain HTML and Angular elements (directives, markup, filters or form controls).
They can be cached and referenced by an id.

ROUTES (ngRoute) allows changing what we see in the app depending on the URL (route).
Every time the URL changes, $routeProvider will inject a new template and controller into ng-view.

SERVICES (Factories) are a way to inject data dependencies into controllers.
They are created through factories.

FILTERS allow you to format and transform data. They change the output of expressions inside the curly braces.
You can chain many filters and also define your own filters.

HTTP REQUESTS are make by "$http" which is a core service that allow to make "XMLHttpRequest" or "json" request.
You can pass an object with http verb and url or call $http.verb ($http.get, $http.post).

PROMISE: "$http" returns a promise which has a "success" or "error" function.

RESOURCES Itâ€™s an Angular service that has a higher level of abstraction of $http to deal with RESTful requests.

NG-DIRECTIVES

- ng-app: is a directive that bootstrap AngulasJS. It designates the caller element as the root.
- ng-model: is a directive that binds and keep data (model) and visual elements (HTML) in sync.
- ng-controller: is a directive that tells angular what function controller to use for a particular view.
- ng-view: is a directive used by $routeProvider to render templates on it.
- ng-template: <script type="text/ng-template" id="/template.html"></script>

- ng-bind: is a directive that binds application data to the HTML view.
- expressions or {{ }}: are a way of binding models to elements in HTML.

- ng-repeat: It is going to iterate for each element and sub-element where this directive is declared.

=======================================================================================================================

FILTERS

- filter: search for a given string in an array and return matches.
- number: adds comma-separated 1000's and teo decimal places.
- currency: the same as number and adds a $ in front.
- date: takes a unix timestamp or date string and output it in a new format.
- JSON: converts javascript objects to JSON strings.
- lowercase/uppercase: convert string to lowercase/uppercase.
- limitTo: number of elements from an array to show.
- orderBy: order array of objects by a key that you specify.

OVERVIEW

AngularJS tries to provide a easy code complexity and readability:
- It decouples DOM manipulation from the application logic.
- AngularJS features save you from much boilerplate code.
- Provides solutions for writing modular code and dependencies management.

MVW (Model-View-Whatever)
- view: visual elements (HTML).
- controller: javascript code (behavior and callbacks).
- model: data (POJO).

(model) <- $scope - (controller) - $scope -> (view)

1. AngularJS loads.
2. ng-app it's compiled.
3. Directives are bound to data, events and DOM transformations.
4. All data models and directives are referenced in the scope.
5. Everything that is attached to the $scope, it is watched by AngularJS and updated.
